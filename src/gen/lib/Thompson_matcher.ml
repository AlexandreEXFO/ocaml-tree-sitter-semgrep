(*
   Regular expression matcher with path capture.

   It uses Thompson's algorithm, together with path tracking.
   Thompson's algorithm consists in creating an NFA representing the
   regular expression. Then the input string is scanned in parallel
   for all possible paths. When multiple paths hit the same state at
   the same time, they are merged, i.e. we only keep one path.
   Matching is successful if at the end of the input, there is one path
   on the accepting state. The matching path is a stack that can then be
   converted to a tree.

   Thanks to path merging, the complexity of the algorithm is O(nm),
   where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the
   regular expression.
